# PythonProblems

Problem 1

n is an intigner and you imput it in the prgram.


The computer uses the formula written to give the answer.

After the number is printed, the program gives a print of the answer.

Problem 2

Import the datetime on the computer

If today beging with a T then it will print "Today begins with a T".

There are only 2 days that beging with T which are tuesday and thursday.

Tuesday is the 2nd day and Thursday is the 4th so they are represented by 2 and 4 abd are put in the if statement

However if its not true, then it will say "Today does not begin with a T"

Problem 3

The 'for' loop makes a list of numbers between 1000 and 10,000 (10,001 is used to make sure the range is correct)

the a%6==0 shows that the number is divisable by 6. % referes to the modulus of 6.

while the a%12!=0 us used to make sure its not divisable by 12

Problem 4

First you add in your positive integer.

When n does not equal 1, it prints the number

if the number is even, divide by 2

If number is odd, is uses the 3n+1 formula

the system keeps going til the number reaches 1.

If it reaches 1, it can't divide by 1 thus the program finishes

Problem 5

A prime number a number that is divisible only by itself and 1.In order to find the number, we need to establish a program that determines one. 

The way to do that is to make dure the number is a positive intiger, divisible by 2 integers (1 and itself) and that it can't be 1 since it isn't a prime number.

Tthe input number is divided by all the numbers in the range of 2 to (number – 1) to see whether there are any positive divisors other than 1 and number itself.

If any divisor is found then we display that the “number is not a prime number” else we display that the “number is a prime number”.

Problem 6

You start off by adding a setence with the input command.

Then by using the split option you split the setence up into the words
