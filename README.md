# PythonProblems

Problem 1

n is an intigner and you imput it in the prgram.


The computer uses the formula written to give the answer.

After the number is printed, the program gives a print of the answer.

Problem 2

Import the datetime on the computer

If today beging with a T then it will print "Today begins with a T".

There are only 2 days that beging with T which are tuesday and thursday.

Tuesday is the 2nd day and Thursday is the 4th so they are represented by 2 and 4 abd are put in the if statement

However if its not true, then it will say "Today does not begin with a T"

Problem 3

The 'for' loop makes a list of numbers between 1000 and 10,000 (10,001 is used to make sure the range is correct)

the a%6==0 shows that the number is divisable by 6. % referes to the modulus of 6.

while the a%12!=0 us used to make sure its not divisable by 12

Problem 4

First you add in your positive integer.

When n does not equal 1, it prints the number

if the number is even, divide by 2

If number is odd, is uses the 3n+1 formula

the system keeps going til the number reaches 1.

If it reaches 1, it can't divide by 1 thus the program finishes

Problem 5

A prime number a number that is divisible only by itself and 1.In order to find the number, we need to establish a program that determines one. 

The way to do that is to make dure the number is a positive intiger, divisible by 2 integers (1 and itself) and that it can't be 1 since it isn't a prime number.

Tthe input number is divided by all the numbers in the range of 2 to (number – 1) to see whether there are any positive divisors other than 1 and number itself.

If any divisor is found then we display that the “number is not a prime number” else we display that the “number is a prime number”.

Problem 6

You start off by adding a setence with the input command.

Then by using the split option you split the setence up into the words

Problem 7

when adding the input, you make sure the number is a float number by "float" in the input
you use ** to get the exponentiation of a number and you can find the square root of the number by rasing the number to the power of 1/2 (or 0.5)

Problem 8

you use the import function to import the date time

then use the now function to import todays date and then the print one to share the date and time.

when printing the drtftime you use the %d for the day, %m for the month, %y for year, %H for hour, %M for minutes and %s for seconds

problem 9

To open the file, use the built-in open() function.

The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file:

You use the r to default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist

You can return one line by using the readline() method

By calling readline() two times, you can read the two first lines:
